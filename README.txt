What is Tweetworks?

Tweetworks is a service and site built on top of Twitter allowing a user to create public
and private groups (instead of hashtags) with threaded conversations and more.

Tweetworks is a Boston-area startup created by @MikeLangford, and it features a
full-fledged web service API.
